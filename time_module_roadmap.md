## Context

The S-CORE v1.0 roadmap is structured around four release gates.
Each gate has **mandatory minimum deliverables**; teams are free to advance ahead
but the gate requirements are non-negotiable for the final release.

| Milestone | Period               | Project Focus                                              |
| --------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **v0.8**  | 13 May – 13 Jul 2026 | Requirements Engineering (PA2) + Architecture Design (PA3) |
| **v0.9**  | 14 Jul – 7 Sep 2026  | Implementation — Detailed Design (PA4)                     |
| **v0.10** | 8 Sep – 2 Nov 2026   | Verification — Coverage & Inspection Completeness (PA5)    |
| **v1.0**  | 3 Nov – 15 Dec 2026  | Hardening & Release                                        |

**v0.8 establishes the baseline** for the Time module. The v0.8 delivery comprises all work
done to date — existing process artefacts in draft state, the existing CI setup, unit tests,
and the `reference_integration` onboarding
([#68](https://github.com/eclipse-score/inc_time/issues/68) under PI
[#69](https://github.com/eclipse-score/inc_time/issues/69)) — plus any work completed before
the gate closes on 13 Jul 2026.

This roadmap maps out a step-by-step plan to reach all v1.0 targets by December 2026, with
v0.9 as the primary catch-up sprint for process artefacts.

**Feature scope for v1.0** — features marked `deferred` have no `valid_from ≤ v1.0` on their
`feat_req` nodes and are automatically excluded from v1.0 coverage statistics. Their `feat_req`
nodes and component artefacts (`comp_req`, `comp_arc`, `comp_dd_sta`) will progress through the
full maturity cycle (`L2+` → `L4`) in a subsequent PI.

| Feature             |    v1.0    | Notes        |
| ------------------- | :--------: | ------------ |
| `SteadyTime`        |     ✓      |              |
| `SystemTime`        |     ✓      |              |
| `VehicleTime`       |     ✓      |              |
| `HighResSteadyTime` |     ✓      |              |
| `AbsoluteTime`      | `deferred` | post-v1.0 PI |

| L2+   | `valid+`    | `valid` + `valid_from` attribute set on each node (enables release coverage statistics)                         |
| L3    | `filed`     | `valid` + inspection checklist submitted; all findings tracked with milestone ≤ v1.0                            |
| L3+   | `filed+`    | Inspection done; all findings documented; accepted deviations have a tracked resolution plan; `:status: valid`  |
| L4    | `inspected` | `:status: valid(inspected)`; all findings resolved; approved by a Committer                                     |

For CI / quality metrics, target values are stated directly (e.g. `≥ 85%` C0, `≥ 50%`).

## Summary: Gate Compliance vs Project Requirements

The table below compares what the **project roadmap requires** at each gate against what the
Time module can **realistically deliver** given the v0.8 baseline state.

| Gate      | Target                                                                                          | Expected Delivery                                                                                                                                     | Gap / Risk                                                              |

| **v0.9**  | All `comp_req` + `aou_req` + `comp_arc` + `comp_dd_sta` L2; `feat_req` `valid_from` set        | All comp artefacts L2; `feat_req` `valid_from` set; SCA reducing; `RecordProperty` traceability added; feat IT L1                                     | **Medium** — tight sprint scope; 4 components × 4 artefact types       |
| **v0.10** | Req / arch L3; DD L3; SCA reducing; coverage ≥ 90%/70%; `comp_req` coverage ≥ 25%; feat IT ≥ 50%  | `feat_req` L3; `comp_req` + AoU + arch + DD L3; checklists filed; coverage ≥ 25%; feat IT ≥ 50% in-scope; MVR L1                                     | **Low** — safety L1 only; PVR deferred to v1.0                         |
| **v1.0**  | Req / arch L4; inspection checklists L3+; DD L3; coverage ≥ 95%/85%; `comp_req` cov ≥ 50%; MVR + safety L2 | All req/arch/feat-arc L4; inspection L3+; DD L3 ³; coverage ≥ 95%/85%; `comp_req` cov ≥ 50%; SCA active, tracked; MVR L2 ³; safety L2 ³; PVR L1 | **None** — targets met                                                  |
